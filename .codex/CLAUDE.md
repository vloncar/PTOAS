# PTOAS Codex Skill Index

This repository keeps AI-assistant project knowledge in Codex skill format under `.codex/skills/`.

Primary skills:

- `ptoas-project-development`: project-wide development rules, cross-layer sync, tests, examples, and file headers.
- `ptoas-publish-pr`: safely stage intended PTOAS changes, check `gh auth status`, remind the user to run `gh auth login` if needed, push to `origin`, and open or update a PR against the canonical repo.
- `build-ptoas-wsl`: WSL build, install, runtime environment, and smoke-test workflow.
- `camodel-isa-verification`: PTO-ISA CA model ST tests, instruction logs, latency checks, and UB dump verification.
- `msprof-op-simulator-insight`: `msprof op simulator` collection and MindStudio Insight export workflow.

The old `.codex/rules/` and `.codex/skill/` entries have been migrated into standard `SKILL.md` files so Codex can discover and invoke them directly.
