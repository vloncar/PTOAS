description: Publish PTOAS changes to GitHub as a pull request. Use when Codex needs to turn intended local PTOAS edits into a branch, commit, push, and PR, especially when the worktree contains unrelated files, the repo uses `origin` as a personal fork and `upstream` as the canonical repository, or GitHub authentication may need to be checked with `gh auth status` and `gh auth login`.

# PTOAS Publish PR

## Overview

Use this skill to safely publish PTOAS work from the local checkout. Confirm the intended scope, keep unrelated files out of the commit, push the branch to `origin`, and open or update a PR against the canonical repository.

## Preconditions

Check GitHub CLI first:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If GitHub CLI is not authenticated, ask the user to run:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Then re-run `gh auth status` before attempting PR operations that rely on `gh`.

Inspect the repository wiring:

```bash
git remote -v
```

In this repository, expect:

- `origin` to be the user's fork
- `upstream` to be `hw-native-sys/PTOAS`

## Workflow

1. Confirm branch and worktree state:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status -sb
```

If the worktree contains unrelated tracked or untracked files, do not include them by default. Stage only the files that belong in the PR.

2. If currently on `main`, create a feature branch:

```bash
git switch -c codex/<short-description>
```

If already on a non-default branch for the task, stay on that branch.

3. Stage only the intended files. Prefer explicit paths:

```bash
git add -- <path1> <path2> ...
git status --short
git diff --cached --stat
```

Use `git add -A` only when the entire worktree is intentionally part of the PR.

4. Run the most relevant validation before commit. For `.codex/skills` work, validate each affected skill with `quick_validate.py`.

5. Commit with a short message:

```bash
git commit -m "<terse-summary>"
```

6. Push to the fork:

```bash
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

7. Open or update the PR:

- Prefer a draft PR unless the user explicitly wants ready-for-review.
- If the current branch is already attached to an open PR, pushing new commits updates that PR automatically.
- When creating a new PR, target `upstream/main` if the branch lives on the fork and the canonical repo is `hw-native-sys/PTOAS`.
- Use the GitHub app connector when available. Use `gh pr create` as a fallback after `gh auth status` confirms login.

Example fallback:

```bash
gh pr create --repo hw-native-sys/PTOAS --base main --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --draft --title "[codex] <summary>" --body-file <path-to-body>
```

## Safety Checks

- Never stage unrelated user changes silently.
- Never clean or reset the worktree just to make publishing easier.
- Keep untracked scratch directories out of the PR unless the user explicitly wants them included.
- Re-check `git status --short` after commit; only unrelated leftover files should remain.
- If `git push` fails because of auth, confirm `gh auth status` and ask the user to run `gh auth login` when needed.

## Publish Summary

Before finishing, report:

- branch name
- commit SHA
- whether the push succeeded
- PR URL if one exists
- what validation was run
